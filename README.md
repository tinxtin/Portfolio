# edx-challenge-2

## Description

Part of the edx-bootcamp challenge. For this week, the goal is to design our own personal portfolio that can be used to introduce myself to other developers, showcase my personal projects and ways to contact me for collaboration or work.

The web portfolio as for now contains 3 sections; about section which has quick introduction about myself, how I got into web development and what I do outside of coding. Then there is the project section, which right doesn't contains much other than placeholder images etc, but rest assure there will be personal project that will added in the near future. Lastly the contact section, which simple tells ways to get in contact with me.

Please note that alot of the functionality hasnt been implement yet, so there are alot placeholders and some button that doesnt do much as of right now.
